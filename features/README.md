# Features (architecture only)

This folder hosts feature modules. The app is age-driven and stage-driven,
so each domain is organized to filter content by child age or phase.

Planned modules:
- age-stages: stage definitions for pregnancy, 0-12 months, 1-3 years, 3-5 years
- child-profile: child profile and personalization logic
- milestones: development milestones by stage
- guidance-symptoms: educational symptoms guidance (non-diagnostic)
- guidance-autism: autism suspicion guidance (non-diagnostic)
- routines: sleep, nutrition, behavior, screen time guidance

No UI or content is implemented here yet.
